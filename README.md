Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 

This is my attempt to make a stable LineageOS 14.1 build out of a similar device with all the features working.
=============

The Sony Xperia M (codenamed _"Nicki"_) is a mid-range smartphone from Sony Mobile.

It was announced on 4 June 2013.

Nicki was supported in CyanogenMod 11, 12.1, 13, 14.1 and now by LineageOS 14.1

This branch is for building LineageOS 14.1 (or Android Nougat 7.1 AOSP based) ROMS.
